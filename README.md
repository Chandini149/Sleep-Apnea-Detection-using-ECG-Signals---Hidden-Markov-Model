# Sleep-Apnea-Detection-using-ECG-Signals---Hidden-Markov-Model
This project uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to detect sleep apnea events (apneas, hypopneas, no apneas) from polysomnographic data, achieving 51.92% accuracy. Challenges include imbalanced data, overfitting, and limited feature sets. Findings highlight HMM potential for refining automated sleep apnea detection in clinical settings.
